I used ChatGPT to ask questions about C++ language features, some concrete examples include:
- How to invoke parent class constructor in child class
- How to inline initialize a struct
- How to make purely virtual class

These could have been answered by Google Search I guess, but LLMs allow for fast follow up questions.

All source code was written by me through physical key tapping :D
